					But don't get too smug. There's still plenty of horrific ways it could all fall apart. In this article, you'll learn 
					about a few of our favorites.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Mayan Doomsday</h2>
				<p>
					Skeptics suggest that the Mayan calendar simply rolls to a new 5,126-year era after 2012, and doesn't actually predict 
					a life-ending apocalypse. But given that the long-dead Mayans were wrong about virtually everything else, why should we 
					trust them on this?			
				</p>

				<h2>Robot Takeover</h2>
				<p>
					Not quite as frightening as a Vampire Takeover or Living-Dead Takeover, a robot rebellion is still a disquieting thought. 
					We are already outnumbered by our technological gadgets, and even Bill Gates fears the day his Japanese robot slave turns 
					him over by the ankles and asks (in a suitably robotic voice) "Who's your daddy now?"

						We don't know how the universe started, so we can't be sure it will not just end, maybe today.

				<h2>Unexplained Singularity</h2>
				<p>
					We don't know how the universe started, so we can't be sure it won't just end, maybe today, and maybe with nothing more 
					exciting than a puff of anti-matter and a slight fizzing noise.
				</p>

				<h2>Runaway Climate Change</h2>
				<p>
					Dismissed by some, Al Gore's prophecy of doom may still come true. If it does, we may have to contend with vicious storms, 
					widespread food shortages, and surly air conditioning repairmen.
				</p>

				<h2>Global Epidemic</h2>
				<p>
					Some time in the future, a lethal virus could strike. Predictions differ about the source of the disease, but candidates 
					include monkeys in the African jungle, bioterrorists, birds and pigs with the flu, warriors from the future, an alien race, 
					hospitals that use too many antibiotics, vampires, the CIA, and unwashed brussel sprouts. Whatever the source, it's clearly 
					bad news.
